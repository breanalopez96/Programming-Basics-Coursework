 /*
 	I know the following programming languages:

 Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, InDesign
 I've dabbled in the html & css for the 5D
 but honestly, I dropped the tools course.
 So I'm hoping that this will be both fun and interesting.

<p style=" padding-left: 300; margin-right:200px; margin-left: 200px;
font-family: Avenir Next; color: #111"> Hello! I am currently a candidate for  graduation in fall 2019 with a BA in Graphic and Information Design at Northeastern University in Boston.
I was born in Boston and currently reside in Providence, RI, where I spend most of my spare time playing with makeup and watching episodes of The Good Doctor or Dear White People.
(How do you travel from Providence every day?!...It's motivated by cheaper rent prices.)</p>

<p style=" padding-left: 300; margin-right:200px; margin-left: 200px; font-family: Avenir Next; color: #111"> I was raised in a household very fond of art.
  My mother would take me to various museums growing up to view artists such as Kauffer, Degas, Kandinsky (just to name some of my favorites) and many more.
  She would encourage me to draw, paint, photograph, sculpt anything that I wanted to. Later on, my experience with graphic and information design began in high school with an internship
  at the computer clubhouse at the Museum of Science, where a former manager gave me the exposure and the proper tools to begin to learn the techniques of design.
  From there, it sparked an interest and I wanted to learn more about the process.
  College came and I got the opportunity to take art classes before transferring to my current school, where I have stuck with the design classes that have allowed me to hone my skills. <p/>

<p style=" padding-left: 300; margin-right:200px; margin-left: 200px; font-family: Avenir Next; color: #111">In terms of photography, the story is a little different.
  When I was younger, I always loved taking photos of places, people, and many inanimate objects. By the beginning
   of middle school, I had created a "portfolio" (really a childhood scrap book) of all printed images from a shoot around the neighborhood that I grew up in.
   However, I was incapable of affording a professional photography camera growing up. So I found ways to actually get some photograph experience in.
   With the same internship at the computer clubhouse at the MOS, I would photograph friends and music groups that would come to the clubhouse was well as borrow cameras to go around the city and shoot what I had seen.
   In high school, I attended the Institute of Contemporary Art's Photography School that they held for high school students and allowed students to borrow cameras there as well. This was really helpful, as the school managed to allow me to get my first real developed prints of photographs that I had taken. Since then, I have taken a college level photograph course and plan on continuing to learn the craft more.
</p>

<p style=" padding-left: 300; margin-right:200px; margin-left: 200px; font-family: Avenir Next; color: #111"> In the future, I hope to learn more about coding.
  Since the last project in a 5D course allowed me to gain some basic knowledge, I hope that the progamming course will show ideas that can be used to code UI|UX designs for websites.
